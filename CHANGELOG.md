Bicleaner 0.12:
* Bicleaner hardrules changes:
  * New rule: c_identical_wo_punct to reject sentences only different in punctuation (and it's case insensitive)
  * New rule:  Sentences containing "Re:" are rejected
  * Rule change: c_minimal_length now rejects sentences with both sides <= 3 words (instead of only one)
  * Rule change: c_identical and c_identical_wo_digits now is case insensitive
  * Rule change: Breadcrumbs rule now split into c_no_breadcrumbs1 and c_no_breadcrumbs2
  * Rule change: Breadcrumbs2 now includes character "Â·" in the rejected characters
  * Rule change: c_length now compares byte length ratio (will avoid rejecting valid sentences due to length ratio when comparing languages with different alphabets)
  * Changed behaviour for `--annotated_output` argument in hardrules. See README.md for more information.
  * New parameter: `--disable_lang_ident` flag to avoid applying rules that need to identify the language
* Bicleaner classify changes:  
  * Now using only 3 decimal places for Bicleaner score and LM score
  * Removed INFO messages when processes starting/ending (except when debugging)
  * New parameter: '--disable_hardrules' flag to avoid applying hardrules
  * New parameter: '--disable_lang_ident' flag to avoid applying rules that need to identify the language
  * New parameter: '--score_only' flag to output only Bicleaner scores (proposed by [@kirefu](https://github.com/kirefu))
* Bicleaner features changes:
  * Fixed bug when probability in prob_dict is 0 (issue [#19](https://github.com/bitextor/bicleaner/issues/19))
* Other:
  * Fixed sklearn version to 0.19.1
  * Added utilities for training: `shuffle.py` and `dict_pruner.py`
  * Updated instalation guides in readme
